# mysql_mag
MySQL scripts for Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)

Part of [sql_mag](https://github.com/cchacua/sql_mag).


# Notes:

This is just and adaptation from my repository to PostgreSQL, [pg_mag](https://github.com/cchacua/pg_mag).


I have not yet run this script, so I am not sure it this works. Additional modifications are required.
